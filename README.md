1/29/24: Created the files and some of the logic for the website. 1/30/24 pt 1: Built out more of the logic for the website, with all of the data from the PokeAPI populating on the screen. Right now I am working on local storage. 1/30/24 pt 2: All of the logic and JS should be done, now I need to work on styling. 1/31/24: Turned out I needed more work on the JS to remove Sylvion from Eevee's evolution tree, so I did that. Added some styling.
