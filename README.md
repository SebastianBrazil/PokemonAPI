Pokemon API Challenge

Designed at 1920 by 1080px, 768 by 900px, 425 by 720px; This website is able to display information about any pokemon that is searched up and is before generation 5. It utilizes the pokeAPI to do so. It is also capable of favoriting pokemon, allowing easy access to those favorites.

1/29/24: Created the files and some of the logic for the website. 1/30/24 pt 1: Built out more of the logic for the website, with all of the data from the PokeAPI populating on the screen. Right now I am working on local storage. 1/30/24 pt 2: All of the logic and JS should be done, now I need to work on styling. 1/31/24: Turned out I needed more work on the JS to remove Sylvion from Eevee's evolution tree, so I did that. Added some styling. 2/1/24: Completed styling and responsiveness for the website. Added more JS because you can never have enough. Finished. 

Peer Review, Caleb Sylvia: Site is super simple and nice. Suggestions I would have it to have like a tab on the side possibly to see the favorites because if the list gets extensive it might not flow right with the screen. The autocomplete in the search is nice with the favorites but needs to be aligned with the search bar. It's awkwardly sitting the the right a bit. Overall everything functions as it should, the evolutions would be cool if it was visualized but that is just a personal suggestion.
